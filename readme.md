############################# HANGMAN GAME by Franck ##############################

A list of word is given to the computer, and ramdomly
selected by the program, I made use of the random module.
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes. 
If the player guesses a letter which exists in the word, 
the script writes it in all its correct positions and
removes the letter from the letter box.
Anytime a letter is guessed, and it's wrong the program
draws a part of the hangman until the full body is drawn
and a message (you won / you lost) is displayed to the user. 
the program asks the user if they would like to play one more time
just press right or left click and there you go with another
word to guess. You can quit the game anytime, by closing the window.
This is a pretty simple game, but cool for beginners in python especially
it covers a lot of key concepts that will help you build your 
python skill.
